An experiment with [bracket_lib](https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib)
and [legion](https://github.com/amethyst/legion), building a simple roguelike.

This started when I followed the the excellent [Roguelike Tutorial - In Rust](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/),
to learn about ECS. It has diverted a lot.

It is not much of a game yet. Maybe one day it will be more fun playing than coding it?
